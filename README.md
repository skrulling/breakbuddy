## 🔥🔥 BreakBuddy Pomodoro Mode 🍅🔥🔥

Ready to level up your productivity, bro? BreakBuddy's got you covered with our **Pomodoro Mode**! 

So, what's this Pomodoro thing all about? It's simple, dude. It's a productivity hack that's going to get you in the zone. 🧠💡 

Here's how it works:

1. You grind for **25 minutes**. No distractions, just pure hustle. 

2. When your time's up, BreakBuddy taps you on the shoulder and says "Hey bro, take 5!". This is your **short break**. Grab a drink, do some stretches, check out what's happening in the world, or whatever chills you out. 🏝️

3. Rinse and repeat three times. On the fourth time, BreakBuddy says "Hey bro, take a longer break, you've earned it". Now you get a **15-minute break** to recharge. 🚀

4. After your long break, you start over. Simple, right?

To start the Pomodoro Mode, just run the `breakbuddy.pomodoroStart` command in the command palette. 

- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette
- Search for "BreakBuddy: Start Pomodoro Mode"

That's it, bro! Now get back to that grind and let BreakBuddy handle your break schedule.

Remember, staying productive isn't about working non-stop. It's about working smart. And taking regular breaks is part of working smart. So let's get those gains, bro! 💪💪💪
